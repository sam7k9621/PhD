The event selection criteria are based on the lepton+jets channel signature of the \ttbar process.
The signal events are required to contain one reconstructed lepton, and at least four reconstructed jets, including two \PQb-tagged jets (defined below) originating from \ttbar decays.
The events are further categorized into two channels based on the lepton flavor: either electron or muon.
Events are selected at the trigger level using single-lepton triggers, which require the presence of an isolated lepton above a \PT threshold in the range 24--35\GeV, depending on the year, and $\abseta < 2.4$.
The same trigger selection is applied to data and to the simulated samples.
