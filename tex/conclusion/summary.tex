The results of a search have been presented for the combined charge conjugate and parity (CP) violation effects in top quark-antiquark events performed in the electron+jets and muon+jets final states.
The top quark and antiquark are each assumed to decay into a bottom quark and a \PW boson, with one \PW boson decaying hadronically and the other leptonically into an electron or muon and accompanying neutrino.
This study uses data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC from proton-proton collisions at \newTeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138\fbinv.
The CP-violating asymmetries are obtained with four different triple-product T-odd observables, where T is the time-reversal operator, constructed using linearly independent four-momentum vectors associated with the final-state particles.
The asymmetries are computed using the fitted signal.
There are no statistically significant indications of CP violation, with all the CP asymmetries being consistent with the standard model expectations.
The resulting combined measurement of the dimensionless chromoelectric dipole moment gives $\dtG=0.04\pm0.10\stat\pm0.07\syst$ and exhibits no evidence for CP-violating effects, consistent with expectations from the standard model.
These results are compatible with a previous study performed by CMS in data from \pp collisions at \oldTeV~\cite{CPVtop:CMSresult} with uncertainties improved by roughly a factor of 3.
