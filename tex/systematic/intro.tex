The sources of systematic uncertainty considered in this paper are presented below in the following order: intrinsic detector bias, other experimental uncertainties, and theoretical uncertainties.
The systematic effects are expected to contribute similarly to the positive and negative regions of each CP observable, thereby largely canceling in the ratio shown in Eq.~\eqref{eq:counting_method}, used to measure the CP asymmetries.
